# Script directory

This dir includes powershell executables, can be directly opened by powershell.exe or pwsh.exe (powershell 7)

1. Add this dir into user $PATH to run them directly.

2. Add shortcut to 'AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs' for windows home search or powertoys command pallet to find it. Better default to use powershell 7 to open it.
